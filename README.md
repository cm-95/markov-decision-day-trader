### Equity Portfolio Optimization and Day Trading Using Markov Decision Process

Build a stochastic transition model in the form of a day trading bot using Markov Decision Process. The model should choose when to buy (1) and when to not buy (0) a stock. The model assumes a holding period of 24 hours for each stock where it is bought and sold at the auction close. £50 worth of each stock will be bought at a time.

Data for this project was sourced using Yahoo Finance and the yﬁnance API package in Python.
